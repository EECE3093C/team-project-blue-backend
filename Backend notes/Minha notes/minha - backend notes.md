## Understanding Backend Web development parts and components
*Front end - visuals
*Backend - saves and manages data

*Client - computer that sends a message
*Server - computer that recieve messages

Just having a backend programming language requires a lot of code and is very difficult and lengthy, this is why we use a *backend framework*

We also use *packages* - code others have already written that we can use to do simple tasks
*a package manager is necessary to read these and deal with these 
*each language has their own

### to review - NECESSARY BACKEND COMPONENTS
*1. backend programming language*
*2. backend framework*
*3. package manager*

Which will we be using?
We will try to use Node.js, express, mondgoDB

After haviung these we need to have somewhere to store & manage our data - *a Database!*
*the server needs to interact and access the db.

This type of of communication between computers is called *Request-Response Cycle*

### API - application program interface
All the different types of requests that the backend allows

### Microservicing our code
*This helps us break down our code into sections so things do not get muddy and confusing.
*you can use different backend languages and framework for different microservices

### Cloud computing
*SaaS - software as a service
*IaaS - infrustructure as a service
*PaaS - Platform as a service
